% function [g,q,n] = RR_IntGCF(a,b)
% Solve for the GCF of the integers a and b via Euclid's algorithm.
% INPUTS:  a,b = input integers, with |a| >= |b|
% OUTPUTS: g   = greatest common factor (GCF) of a,b
%          q   = quotients generated during the running of Euclid's algorithm
%          n   = number of steps taken by Euclid's algorithm
% TEST:    a=int32(385),  b=int32(357), [g,q,n] = RR_IntGCF(a,b)  % Apply Euclid's alorithm to find the GCF g
%          g_normalized=g/g(1)    % Note that g comes out with arbitrary scaling
