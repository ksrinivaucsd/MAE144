function [c,overflow]=RR_binary_add(a,b)
% function [c]=RR_binary_add(a,b)
% INPUTS:  a,b,      two binary strings, stored as character arrays, with the LSB to the right
% OUTPUTS: c         corresponding sum of a and b
%          overflow  flag that indicates if the sum is larger than the input character arrays.
% TEST:    c=RR_binary_add('01001','11')
% NOTE! This code is NOT AT ALL efficient, and is meant for pedagogical purposes only.
% To accomplish binary addition efficiently, lower-level commands (in C or assembler) are required.
