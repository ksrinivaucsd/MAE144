% script RR_Linkwitz_Riley_filters.m
% generates and makes the Bode plots of the 2nd, 4th, and 8th order LR
% complementary filters.  Note that each pair add up to all-pass filters, with
% unit gain across all frequencies.  Their overall phase loss (of 180, 360, and 720
% degrees, respectively) is the price you pay for stability [it doesn't affect
% audio reproduction too noticably, but if using for control you gotta be aware of
% it, especially in the vicinity of crossover]
